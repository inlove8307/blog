Welcome to Netlify

Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow.



\#Get started

To get started with Netlify, learn how to create deploys. Options for creating deploys range from connecting a Git repository for continuous deployment to publishing a site folder with drag and drop. Use the Deploy to Netlify button on our JAMstack templates to create a Git repository linked to a Netlify site that you can experiment with.



\#Discover Netlify

Explore our documentation to learn about Netlify products and features. Here are some highlights from each section of the docs:



Configure builds – Netlify can run your build command and deploy the result whenever you push to your Git repo. Get started with basic build settings, learn about managing build dependencies, and explore additional options available with file-based configuration.



Site deploys – Atomic deploys with Netlify guarantee that your site is always consistent. Learn how to manage deploys, enable deploy notifications, and run a branch-based split test.



Monitor sites – Learn how Netlify Analytics lets you monitor trends in site activity. Monitor builds to understand the role individual sites play in your team's builds usage. Explore what kinds of logs and notifications are available for your sites.



Domains & HTTPS – Register a new domain in the Netlify UI, or use a domain you already own, to assign a custom domain to your site. Either way, you can have Netlify handle DNS management for you. We provide free automatic HTTPS on all sites.



Routing – Learn about routing options available with redirects, proxies, and custom headers.



Visitor access – Enable site-wide password protection, authenticate users with Netlify Identity, or configure role-based access control.



Forms – You can use Netlify Forms without adding API calls or extra JavaScript on your site, configure extra spam prevention beyond our automatic spam filtering, and receive notifications about new submissions.



Functions – Deploy serverless functions built with JavaScript or with Go. You can even trigger function calls when certain Netlify events happen.



Large Media – Get the benefits of Git version tracking for large files without bloating your repository. Use dynamic image transformations so you can upload images at full resolution, then serve the exact size you need when you need it.



Partner add-ons – Learn how to work with add-ons to connect third-party APIs and other microservices to your JAMstack projects on Netlify, discover what partner add-ons are currently available, or make your own add-on.



CLI – You can use Netlify's command line interface to deploy sites or configure continuous deployment. Netlify Dev brings the functionality of your Netlify production environment directly to your local machine.



API – To get started with the Netlify API, learn how to authenticate and make a request. Then explore options for deploying via API and usage for some popular endpoints.



Accounts & billing – Learn about managing team members and how to transfer sites between teams.
